To ensure the docker container deploy operation. Please take this lab. 
The lab contains a simple application that consists of three microservices. The sample application uses three services:

. `webapp`: Web application microservice calls `greeting` and `name` microservice to generate a greeting for a person.
. `greeting`: A microservice that returns a greeting.
. `name`: A microservice that returns a person’s name based upon `{id}` in the URL.

Each application is deployed using different AWS Compute options.

== Setting up Java environment with Maven in Cloud9 
This sample enables you to run some Java code in an AWS Cloud9 development environment.

Creating this sample might result in charges to your AWS account. These include possible charges for services such as Amazon EC2 and Amazon S3.

=== Step1: Install Required Tools
In this step, you install a set of Java development tools in your AWS Cloud9 development environment. If you already have a set of Java development tools such as the Oracle JDK or OpenJDK installed in your environment, you can skip ahead to Step 2: Add Code. This sample was developed with OpenJDK 8, which you can install in your environment by completing the following procedure.

1. Confirm whether OpenJDK 8 is already installed. To do this, in a terminal session in the AWS Cloud9 IDE, run the command line version of the Java runner with the -version option. (To start a new terminal session, on the menu bar, choose Window, New Terminal.)

  $ java -version

Based on the output of the preceding command, do one of the following:

* If the output states that the java command isn't found, continue with step 2 in this procedure to install OpenJDK 8.
* If the output contains values starting with Java(TM), Java Runtime Environment, Java SE, J2SE, or Java2, the OpenJDK isn't installed or isn't set as the default Java development toolset. Continue with step 2 in this procedure to install OpenJDK 8, and then switch to using OpenJDK 8.
* If the output contains values starting with java version 1.8 and OpenJDK, skip ahead to Step 2: Add Code. OpenJDK 8 is installed correctly for this sample.
* If the output contains a java version less than 1.8 and values starting with OpenJDK, continue with step 2 in this procedure to upgrade the installed OpenJDK version to OpenJDK 8.

2. Ensure the latest security updates and bug fixes are installed. To do this, run the yum tool with the update command.

  $ sudo yum -y update

3. Install OpenJDK 8. To do this, run the yum tool with the install command, specifying the OpenJDK 8 package.

  $ sudo yum -y install java-1.8.0-openjdk-devel

4. Switch or upgrade the default Java development toolset to OpenJDK 8. To do this, run the update-alternatives command with the --config option. Run this command twice to switch or upgrade the command line versions of the Java runner and compiler.

  $ sudo update-alternatives --config java
  $ sudo update-alternatives --config javac

At each prompt, type the selection number for OpenJDK 8 (the one that contains java-1.8).

5. Confirm that the command line versions of the Java runner and compiler are using OpenJDK 8. To do this, run the command line versions of the Java runner and compiler with the -version option.

  $ java -version
  $ javac -version

If OpenJDK 8 is installed and set correctly, the Java runner version output contains a value starting with openjdk version 1.8, and the Java compiler version output starts with the value javac 1.8.

=== Step 2: Set Up to Use the AWS SDK for Java
You can enhance this sample to use the AWS SDK for Java to create an Amazon S3 bucket, list your available buckets, and then delete the bucket you just created.

In this step, you install Apache Maven or Gradle in your environment. Maven and Gradle are common build automation systems that can be used with Java projects. After you install Maven or Gradle, you use it to generate a new Java project. In this new project, you add a reference to the AWS SDK for Java. This AWS SDK for Java provides a convenient way to interact with AWS services such as Amazon S3, from your Java code.

==== Set Up with Maven 
1. Install Maven in your environment. To see whether Maven is already installed, using the terminal in the AWS Cloud9 IDE, run Maven with the -version option.

  $ mvn -version

If successful, the output contains the Maven version number. If Maven is already installed, skip ahead to step 4 in this procedure to use Maven to generate a new Java project in your environment.

2. Install Maven by using the terminal to run the following commands. These commands get information about the package repository where Maven is stored, and then use this information to install Maven.

  $ sudo wget http://repos.fedorapeople.org/repos/dchen/apache-maven/epel-apache-maven.repo -O /etc/yum.repos.d/epel-apache-maven.repo
  $ sudo sed -i s/\$releasever/6/g /etc/yum.repos.d/epel-apache-maven.repo
  $ sudo yum install -y apache-maven

3. Confirm the installation by running Maven with the -version option.

  $ mvn -version

=== Test: Build and Test Services using Maven

. Each microservice is in a different repo:
+
[cols="1,3"]
|====
| `greeting` | https://github.com/arun-gupta/microservices-greeting
| `name` | https://github.com/arun-gupta/microservices-name
| `webapp` | https://github.com/arun-gupta/microservices-webapp
|====
+
. Clone all the repos. Open each one in a separate terminal.
. Run `greeting` service: `mvn wildfly-swarm:run`
.. Optionally test: `curl http://localhost:8081/resources/greeting`
. Run `name` service: `mvn wildfly-swarm:run`
.. Optionally test:
... `curl http://localhost:8082/resources/names`
... `curl http://localhost:8082/resources/names/1`
. Run `webapp` service: `mvn wildfly-swarm:run`
. Run the application: `curl http://localhost:8080/`
